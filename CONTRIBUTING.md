# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome**.  
I accept contributions via Pull Request on [Github](https://github.com/mayflower/laravel-crypto-shredder).  

## Pull Requests

- [PSR-12 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-12-extended-coding-style-guide.md) - You can use `composer check-style` and `composer fix-style`
- **Add tests!** - Your PR won't be accepted without tests.
- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle** - I try to follow [SemVer 2.0.0](semver.org). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask me to pull from your master branch.
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. Consider [squash your commits](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

## Running Tests
```bash
$ composer phpunit
```

Happy coding!
